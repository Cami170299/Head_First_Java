# The Java API Library

Inside the Java API all classes are grouped into packages. This with the purpose of dividing them by functionality; GUI, data, Structures, Data-Bases, etc...

- You can create your own packages of classes.

- Packages are also a way to avoid class collisions, by maybe having a class with the same name but different package.

### <p align="center"> Example of a package </p>

### java.util.ArrayList

So within the <b>java.util</b> package we are using the <b>ArrayList</b> class.

#### How to use the class

- Put something on an ArrayList <b>add()</b>
- To remove <b>remove()</b>
- To find where something is <b>indexOf()</b>
- To find if the ArrayList is empty <b>isEmpty()</b>
- Get the number of elements on the ArrayList <b>size()</b>
- ArrayLists only work with object types, if you want them to work with primitives you have to use a respective <b>"Wrapper class"</b>

NOTE: an ArrayList resizes itself dynamically

Due that everything in Java is a package, the most commonly used classes (String, System, etc...) fall under the pre- imported <b>java.lang</b> package.
